/*

Ideas:

-columnHeaderspecifier shouldl be able to keep the path

-there should be a way to wirte the header of a file if it doesnt exist
header would be a string

-there should be a way to vary the columnheader specifier so that 
this class can be used multiple times at multiple locations to write things
to different files

-add exception handling to accomodate for when
a person tries to used the fileutil without specifying 
a chs

-comtemplate whether fileutil should be an object
as to improve reusability other than a static class

-write junit test to improve on testability of this package
